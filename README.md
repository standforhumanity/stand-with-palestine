> **"Enough is enough. Humanity must stand up."**

2. Get rid of [Israeli Products, software and dependencies](/docs/Boycott.md)



## 🕊️ Why This Matters

For over 75 years, the people of Palestine have faced:

- 🚫 Military occupation  
- 🏚️ Forced evictions  
- 🧨 Indiscriminate bombings  
- 🧒 Children losing families, limbs, and futures  
- 🩸 A genocide that the world chooses to ignore

> Gaza is not just a headline. It is a humanitarian catastrophe.  
> We cannot be silent coders in a digital world built by injustice.

### 💥 What's Happening in Gaza?

## 🚧 Over 70% of homes in Gaza destroyed

## 🚑 Hospitals and ambulances targeted

## 🧼 No water, no food, no medicine

## 🧒 60%+ of victims are children and women

## 🔇 A blackout of information and internet

Yet the world’s tech platforms often censor Palestinian voices.

🧡 Humanity Must Be Loud
This is not about religion. It’s about human rights, dignity, and truth.

### 📌 In Memory of the Children of Gaza

## 🧒 For every child who died crying for their mother,  
## 🕊️ For every family erased in an instant,  
## 💔 For every name lost in rubble —  
# we will not forget you.
